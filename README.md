**A double-double arithmetic library for Rust.**

This library provides an implementation of double-double arithmetic for the
Rust language. Note that this is not the same as the IEEE quadruple-precision
floating-point format. Instead, higher precision is obtained by representing
the value as the sum of two non-overlapping `f64` values.

Operator traits are implemented both for reference and value types where
appropriate. The code indicates the source of the algorithms used.

Mathematical constants are available in the `twofloat::consts` module, which
provides the same set of constants as `std::f64::consts`.

Please note that the implementation of the mathematical functions (`exp`,
`powf`, etc.) is very preliminary. In particular, they are calculated using
operations at the same precision as the result, so they will not return values
which are correct to the full precision of the `TwoFloat` type. This may be
addressed in future releases.

## Optional features

* `math_funcs` - include mathematical functions (enabled by default)
* `serde` - enable serialization/deserialization with Serde.

## Known issues

This library depends on the `std` implementations of the floating point
mathematical functions, which in turn depend on the C standard library
implementation, which may have variations between platforms.
